        <h1>Vim startup performance</h1>
        
        <p>Vim already has two built in tools to help figure out what is going on.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--startuptime</code> - a flag to pass to vim to write to a file which files were sourced and how long the execution took.</li>
<li><code>:scriptnames</code> a built in command to display sourced files during the session.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both has great docs in vim.</p>
<h2>Startuptime flag</h2>
<p>Usage</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">vim --startuptime vim.log ./file-to-open
</code></pre>
<p>After the bootup in <code>vim.log</code> you can see contents similar to</p>
<pre><code>times in msec
 clock   self+sourced   self:  sourced script
 clock   elapsed:              other lines

</code></pre>
<p>The first column is a timestamp from the very start.</p>
<p>The second is the time spent executing the specified file. Normally this number is under 50ms.</p>
<h3>Things to note</h3>
<p>Most well written plugins load the core upon needing it aka lazyloading or autoloading in vim terms. Often this happens when dettecting an appropriate filetype, therefore depending on which file/directory you open when passing <code>--startuptime</code> flag the overall time may vary.</p>
<h2>Script names command</h2>
<p>This commands lists all files that were sourced during the session. Due to some plugins autoloading their contents checking the list in the beggining of the session and some time after opening buffers with different filetypes, the list contents will differ.</p>
<h2>Practical usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>if there are 50+ms files it makes sense to investigate or autoload/lazyload these plugins/settings.</li>
<li>if it is an expensive plugin there might be lighter alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been able to shave off just under 200ms of my bootup time by performing the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expensive plugins</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">Nerdtree plugin</a> was using over 50ms to load. Since I only used the shortcuts to add/copy/remove notes for nerdtree buffers. I was able to migrate to <a href="https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish">dirvish</a> for directory viewing and wrote a tiny <a href="https://github.com/antonk52/dirvish-fs.vim">dirvish-fs plugin</a> to add nerdtree like shortcutes for fs manipulation. Sidenote: besides nerdtree being somewhat expensive on bootup it also is slow for large directories so ditching it was a win-win.</li>
<li><strong>Expensive vim settings</strong> - I am terrible at grammar, <code>spelllang</code> drastically helps me with that. It sources dictionaries to specified langues and marks workd that were misspelled. However, sourcing two dictionaries during the bootup is suboptiomal. After moving this setting to a <code>CursorHold</code> autocommand the bootup dropped by another 60ms.</li>
<li><strong>Expensive plugin settings</strong> - ie <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">CoC</a>, I use for lsp stuff. Dynamically enabling coc plugins can also be exccessive for the start up time. Moved some of those to CursorHold autocommand is dropped another 70ms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall the idea was to either avoid unnecessary work or delay it until the file content is shown on the screen.</p>
